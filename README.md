üåü Key Features
Dynamic Persona Creation: You're not just chatting with a generic AI. You define the AI's name and personality, from a "hopeful poet who's always daydreaming" to a "cynical artist with a heart of gold."

Selectable Relationship Scenarios: Choose from different relationship dynamics (Best Friend, Ex, Girlfriend) to fundamentally change the tone and direction of the conversation. Each scenario uses a unique, carefully crafted system prompt.

Rich & Themed UI: A modern, romantic, dark-mode interface with subtle animations, floating hearts, and a clean chat layout to enhance the immersive experience.

Client-Side & Secure: The entire application runs in your browser. Your Gemini API key and chat conversations are not stored or sent to any server, ensuring your privacy. History is cleared on page reload.
